            <h2>How Do Search Engines Work?</h2>
            <p>Search engines create an index of sites by crawling the internet and storing information from websites found across the web into a database. This index is then ordered into a ranked list to return the most relevant search results to users. Search engines consider relevance and popularity to determine the best results.</p> 

            <h2>The Importance of Keywords and Descriptions as Meta Tags</h2>
            <p>Keywords and descriptions as meta tags are not just helpful in determining rank and relevance to users' search results. They are also the advertising pieces of the web pages. They help determine the best results by the process of elimination. While keyword meta tags tell the user the term they're looking for used on a web page, description meta tags describe to a user <em>how</em> that keyword is being used within the context of said web page. Users can determine what web pages are worth looking at instead of wasting time searching for the answer on other pages.</p>

            <h2>The Four Elements That Comprise Writing Relevant Content Links</h2>
            <p>Links should always:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>come from topically relevant sources,</li>
                <li>use anchor text to provide a description, which in turn supports relevance,</li>
                <li>be earned and come from authorative sources,</li>
                <li>and be a mix of follow and nofollow</li>
            </ul><!--50 word minimum-->

            <h2>What is Good Heading Hierarchy?</h2>
            <p>Pages are much more readable when there is structure present. Structure establishes a hierarchy of content visually displayed to users to determine what is most important and how the content relates to each other. Even more importantly, establishing a heading hierarchy across your site makes it more accessible. Therefore, those who use screen readers may navigate a webpage more effectively. Look below at an example of how heading hierarchy can visually represent what information has more importance:</p>
            <h3>See what I am using here is an h3 tag</h3>
            <h4>And this is an h4 tag</h4>
