            <h2>The Importance of Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>Responsive design makes web pages accessible across all devices that provide visual displays of the internet. When creating web pages, it is important to consider user experience. Achieving a great user experience makes the site more desirable and, in return to the developer and/or site owner, the number of views for the site is more likely to increase. With the increase in consumption of mobile devices, users prefer the convenience of being able to take their experiences with them in their pocket. If users have to work through their experience on their mobile devices, they are more likely not to continue interaction.</p> 

            <h2>Three Reports That Google Analytics Produces Regarding Your Site's Audience</h2>

            <h3>Active Users</h3>
            <p>Active User reports allow owners to see trends in the activity across the website. This is important when owners seek long-term users. With these trends documented, owners can determine what it is their audience likes and does not like. Positive and negative impacts can be determined more accurately when the owner can see how changes to the website may affect traffic and the interaction on the site.</p>

            <h3>Lifetime Value</h3>
            <p>Measurable lifetime value can help site owners strategize how to use their marketing resources. This report can capture users through paid search and email. Furthermore, this report can determine the impact of acquiring users through organic search and social media. Owners want to determine which methods bring in the "higher-value" users and Lifetime Value reports achieve that.</p>

            <h3>User Explorer</h3>
            <p>User Explorer reports are unique to a single order. They capture individual user behavior versus the behavior of the site's general audience. This kind of report helps site owners that have user accounts on their site the most. Every user has different needs. This data can help site owners determine how to provide the best user experience to keep their users for the long haul.</p>
